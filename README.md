# Hiya! ＼(＾O＾)／

Here's how to get this up and running locally so you can play around:

- Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:redrambles/event-manager.git`
- Cd into the directory `cd event-manager`
- Install our stuffz `npm install`
- Create the db `rake db:migrate`
- Seed it with some pretty lame data `rake db:seed`
- Run this thing: `./bin/dev`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` - you should see the app!
